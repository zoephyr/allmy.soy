Allmy.soy is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog, powered by [The Paper Design](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) template.

I wanted this blog to be a place to share my crazy thoughts about the world and the beautiful way the web works. Admittedly, this is probably just a place for me to vent some mild takes :^) üçµüí¶

The following blurbs were taken directly from the Paper design template, and I don't intend to change a lot. Maybe colors and theming. I'll obviously update this if things change significantly.

# Redefining Success - Just for Today.

I’m absolutely spiritually cooked from being a dev. It was everything I ever wanted. And truthfully, it still might be… but overall -

I basically hate being a developer anymore. I _need_ to fall in love with programming again. It feels awful to say it, but it’s more and more evidently true - I have to unlearn damn near everything I have learned as a dev if I want to obtain happiness within it moving forward.

It’s been time and time again at multiple companies: I’m not finding enjoyment in the days, the tickets, the teams, the cultures - are all constantly at odds with everything I believe in, how it’s done, and what I truly care about within my craft. This has been the enterprise curse - nearly every company I’ve been at operates at a truly enterprise level, and this has been my downfall : I don’t have a way to interface in smaller teams and make the impact I know I could be making.

This is my struggle. I’m coming up close on the experience and work-history of a senior engineer, and I’m still scraping to get that Junior title where I go. Truthfully, I did not obtain my degree, and this has set me back in multiple efforts. As well, I tend to freeze and forget the knowledge I need right when I need it, costing me interviews I’m otherwise able to nail - that imposter syndrome comes back to bite me hard.

This imposter syndrome has followed me from the first time I had to compare myself to another developer in college - I felt that same fear I feel now around others I feel that far outrank me. It never quite goes away, no matter how much I fight through it. It’s not a matter of me wanting to complain about it, but rather recognizing this insatiable crux of my design - I base my successes off others, which is something I want to change.

> Change, and everything is change. To the degree you go with a stream, you see you are still, you are flowing with it. But to the degree you resist the stream, you see the current is rushing past you, and fighting you. So… swim with it… go with it… and you’re there. You’re at rest.

I’ve been fighting the current for so long, that I forgot my own waters which I swim in. Escaping the cycle is as easy as changing directions - to find the way the current flows and swim with it. It’s harder when you’re surrounded by many currents, many paths, and a plethora of knowledge to cram into your head during the work week.

I’ve realized now that I’ve either given up or deleted all the passion projects along the way that could have made it all worth it - those things that provide the extra drive for this dev thing. It’s difficult while working full-time to make that extra side-time worthwhile - and well, I’m out of dev work right now. I may as well make something that matters in this time I still have to myself.

So, I made this blog post. I want to now put some time and effort into making this thing look halfway decent. So maybe that’s how I’m redefining success for just today. And perhaps I’ll find new ways to define it each and every day with a new mindset.

**One can only hope, because I’m cooked.**

Thanks for reading my soy today.

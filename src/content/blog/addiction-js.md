# I wish...

I wish I could muster up the emotions to talk about my addictive past in the proper context. I figured: If I stare at this blank page and start typing something, after some point, something meaningful may come along. I may have some wise words to pass to anyone going through something similar, but I don’t think I have anything super wise.  I’m selfish here, and I’ll just tell you that it hurt. It sucked, and it still does. I’ve never had a better outlet than a URL on the internet that represents one last bastion of the energy I have yet to release regarding the monster I used to be (and still am) around substances.

# The LSD....

The LSD originally made everything worth living for, and worth dying for all the same. The lines were blurred, and that dissolution of the ego into the non-dualistic truth of the universe is something that gets joked about ad nauseam when it comes to psychedelic talk: but no one who’s talking about these psychedelic experiences gives you the manual on how to navigate your own personal hell, lasting months of abusive cycles as you stare down yourself in the mirror wondering where that person on the other side is slipping off to. It made tolerating the enabler in my life better, and made causing chaos worth it for the experience. I let that man break down who I was, and it was all the on hopes of a dream we were lucky to even have a chance to *try and see* through, much less actually do it.

# If I could take it all back...

If I could take it all back, I know already I simply wouldn’t. It was meant to play this way, the cards were meant to fall this way, and reconciling radical acceptance was always the way this played out. In every scenario, I sat here typing these transgressions into a digital catharsis for the moment to pronounce myself…. alive

# I am not dead yet...

I am not dead yet, despite the fact I should be. I deserve to be alive.  I deserve to feel this air in my lungs. I deserve to know who this person is, who inhabits this body, what body holds this ego: to know the self is a taboo, in every matter of society - how does one coalesce with this when knowing the self is necessary to change who one is? The unfortunate fact is you cannot completely know the self, you can only know parts of what the “self” is and what it means to be part of the greater whole. 

# I know myself... 

I know myself, loosely, but I do. How I wish though, I still did not even partially know myself.
